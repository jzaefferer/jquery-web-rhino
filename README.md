A prototype for running jQuery on the serverside as part of a web framework.

Easiest way to run is loading the project into an Eclipse workspace, with the Maven plugin installed.
Eclipse metadata is in the repository. Once Eclipse compiled everything (no build errors), Run src/test/java/TestRunner as Java Application.

Otherwise you should be able to get it running with "mvn jetty:run". Didn't test that, yet.
